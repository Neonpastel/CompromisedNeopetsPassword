## Transcription
scary monsters and super creeps, oh wait
it's just my friends again, they saved me a seat
at the table that we dine on there's a taper candle tapering
the seconds passing, feeling nauseous, trying not to barf 

an american werewolf,
an american werewolf in london
an american werewolf,
an american werewolf in london

my claws are getting sharper
my eyes are turning black, and now i

wanna go home now and see my family but they'd have heart attacks, so i
guess i'll eat some children or howl at passing cars, cause honey
no one wants to be around these people just like ours, cause we're

american werewolves,
american werewolves in london
an american werewolf,
an american werewolf in london
an american werewolf,
an american werewolf in london
an american werewolf,
an american werewolf in london
