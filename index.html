      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>This is a personal project of mine for things that fall under any or all of the following conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Archive what you can. Companies under capitalism don't care about preservation of the hard work of their employees. Media like software, websites & tv shows get lost to disc rot, link rot, copyright issues, and the like.</li>
        <li>Share & spread information. Vendor lock-in stops archival. Lyrics being only on MusixMatch OR Genius is silly. Community-(and oftenly volunteer-)provided information being locked to one website for the sake of profit is a waste. People should ideally be able to access info on the location that fits them best.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm not a gigantic force or anything, nor do I currently plan on pursuing that. This is just a moniker to contribute to the values I've listed.</p>
