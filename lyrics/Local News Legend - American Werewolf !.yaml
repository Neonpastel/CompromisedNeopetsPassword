  Original: >
    scary monsters and super creeps, oh wait
    it's just my friends again, they saved me a seat
    at the table that we dine on there's a taper candle tapering
    the seconds passing, feeling nauseous, trying not to barf 

    an american werewolf,
    an american werewolf in london
    an american werewolf,
    an american werewolf in london

    my claws are getting sharper
    my eyes are turning black, and now i

    wanna go home and see my family but they'd have heart attacks, so i
    guess i'll eat some children or howl at passing cars, cause honey
    no one wants to be around these people just like ours, cause we're

    american werewolves,
    american werewolves in london
    an american werewolf,
    an american werewolf in london
    an american werewolf,
    an american werewolf in london
    an american werewolf,
    an american werewolf in london
