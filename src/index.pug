      h3 About

      p This is a personal project of mine for things that fall under any or all of the following conditions:
      ul
        li Archive what you can. Companies under capitalism don't care about preservation of the hard work of their employees. Media like software, websites &amp; tv shows get lost to disc rot, link rot, copyright issues, and the like.
        li Share &amp; spread information. Vendor lock-in stops archival. Lyrics being only on MusixMatch OR Genius is silly. Community-(and oftenly volunteer-)provided information being locked to one website for the sake of profit is a waste. People should ideally be able to access info on the location that fits them best.
        
      p I'm not a gigantic force or anything, nor do I currently plan on pursuing that. This is just a moniker to contribute to the values I've listed.
